# Hello there

## Introduction

I am YU Yue (于跃), an undergraduate at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/).

## Research

My research interest includes computer vision and machine learning system. Supervised by [Prof. WONG Ngai](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/), I am currently working on fast 3D reconstruction of large-scale real-world scenes using implicit representation like *neural radiance field* (NeRF). See [my posts](./blog/ml/nerf/) on NeRF.
